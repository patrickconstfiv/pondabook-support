    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 24, 2025</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <p><strong>TL;DR: We don't collect, store, or share any of your personal information. All your data stays on your device and your iCloud account.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to PondaBook. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our app.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect any personal information.</strong></p>
    <p>PondaBook is designed with privacy at its core. We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data on our servers. All information you enter into the app remains exclusively on your device and, if you choose to enable iCloud sync, in your personal iCloud account.</p>

    <h2>How Your Data is Stored</h2>
    <h3>Local Storage</h3>
    <p>All your ledgers, expenses, notes, and other data are stored locally on your device. This data is protected by your device's security features.</p>

    <h3>iCloud Sync (Optional)</h3>
    <p>If you choose to enable iCloud synchronization, your data will be stored in your personal iCloud account. This sync is handled entirely by Apple's iCloud service, and we have no access to this data. Apple's privacy policy governs how your iCloud data is handled.</p>

    <h2>Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect, access, or transmit:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal identification information</li>
        <li>Financial information or transaction details</li>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Usage analytics or statistics</li>
        <li>Device information</li>
        <li>Crash reports or diagnostics</li>
        <li>Cookies or tracking data</li>
        <li>Any other personal or behavioral data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>PondaBook does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. We do not share your data with any third parties because we simply don't have access to it.</p>

    <h2>Data Export</h2>
    <p>The app allows you to export your data in formats such as PDF and Excel. These exports are generated locally on your device, and you have full control over where and how you share them.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app does not collect any information from anyone, including children under 13 years of age.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect or store your data, all your information remains under your complete control:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can delete all your data by uninstalling the app or clearing app data in your device settings</li>
        <li>You can export your data at any time using the app's export features</li>
        <li>You control whether to sync with iCloud through your device settings</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>
